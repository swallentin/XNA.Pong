A C# XNA implementation of Pong.

This code was written by Stephan Wallentin, http://coding4fun.tumblr.com. All this code took about 1 week to write, but probably more since it's
a refactoring of an earlier version of this code base.

The reason for this code was that I wanted to experiment with the MVC pattern and some other design patterns.
So all code can be percieved as lab code. The current version of the code is the third iteration of the same game engine.

All the code is provided as is.
